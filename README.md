Points:
1. movie info/related movies are fetched from mockable api provided
2. To fetch the movie poster i have used node-app (https://github.com/sanoj2018/node-app) which will serve static resources(posters)
3. To store the info regarding the movie like or dislike, i have used localStorage APIS, right now this is done only for one movie 

Pendind in UI side (Improvements):
1. Some CSS changes to look good on all viewport variants
2. We can have some more reusable componets/ styled component created (for images, buttons which are uses vary offen)
